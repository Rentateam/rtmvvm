# Asking Questions

We use GitHub as a support forum, so any questions you can ask there.
Also for any usage questions, please ask on Stack Overflow. By doing so, you'll be more likely to quickly solve your problem, and you'll allow anyone else with the same question to find the answer.

# Contributing

A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed issue when you encounter a problem. We appreciate a well-written bug description.
Check that the project issues database doesn't already include that problem before submitting an issue. If you find a match, add a quick "+1" Doing this helps prioritize the most common problems and requests.

When reporting issues, please include the following:

The version of Xcode you're using
The version of iOS or macOS you're targeting
The full output of any stack trace or compiler error
A code snippet that reproduces the described behavior, if applicable
Any other details that would be useful in understanding the problem
This information will help us review and fix your issue faster.
